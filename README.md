# Email_Template
Implementation thoughts/explanation:
Considered example template from online and implemented using HMTL and CSS
Used two and three column layouts. 
Defined breakpoints (used media queries)
Desktop: Two column layout for images, Mobile: One column layout for images
“Click here to view in browser” is linked to top of the page(To view email in browser - Solutions would be like, Hosting html file in external server or using email solutions)
Some of the links are hyper-referencing to themselves (href=”#”)
Social networking images are linking to their original pages(links)
Some of the images are trimmed and adjusted image/canvas size using photoshop
Images(except logo at header) are using shareable links from google drive.
Used sandbox logo(Just thought to mention)
Used photoshop for adjusting(trimming) footer logo
